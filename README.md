This repository contains a Java banking application developed as part of a university programming assessment at UFFS ([@ccuffs](https://github.com/ccuffs)). The application allows users to simulate fundamental banking operations, including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. It's a practical example of programming concepts applied to a real-world scenario using Java.
